# I'll recalibrate your compass

Coaching relationships for me first of all mean: I want to put you into a position where you don't need me.

We will engage in deep conversations which will most likely include the type of uncomfortable questions you didn't want to answer before.

After getting on board and get a glimpse of your problemosphere we'll slowly start to change things.

I'll throw all my knowledge (in digestable portions), connections and experience at you so you come closer to whatever it is you want to achieve.

Sounds interesting?
