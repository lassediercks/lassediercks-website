# Let me bring your ideas to life

Ui engineering is where I'm the most experienced at and call myself an expert.

Usually projects involve starting or improving a design system but I've also been part of usual client projects and crazy bleeding edge prototypes.

## You want to work with me if

<ul class="ld-list">
<li class="ld-list__item">you think there is a gap between your design and development team</li>
<li class="ld-list__item">you want to build a pattern library but don't know where to start</li>
<li class="ld-list__item">you have 5 different buttons for the same action</li>
<li class="ld-list__item">you think CSS is broken and never want to write it again</li>
<li class="ld-list__item">you struggle to deliver an awesome user experience across big and small devices</li>
<li class="ld-list__item">you want to implement an idea in hours. Not weeks.</li>
<li class="ld-list__item">want to scale your product to an internationally competitive level</li>
</ul>

on the other Hand

## I want to work with you if

<ul class="ld-list">
    <li class="ld-list__item">you value an accessible open web</li>
    <li class="ld-list__item">you have a medium sized product development team (5-20)</li>
    <li class="ld-list__item">you work or want to work agile</li>
    <li class="ld-list__item">you are setup for remote workers or have an office in Hamburg.</li>
</ul>

Should I help you build something?
