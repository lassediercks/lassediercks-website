      <description> Earlier this year my wife and me made a trip that lead us to Barcelona, Toulouse, Rocamadour ( a Village in the Mountains) and Paris. As it kind of re-position what photography means to me and also what life means to me I wanted to share some pictures of the trip.

      <description>On the 1.1. of 2017 I started freelancing.
When I look at things I see the bigger picture, the holistic view, the small details that really matter. That&amp;rsquo;s why I started to build design systems and focus on the process of building web software.
What I noticed along the way is, that there is to turning back. Freelancing is a hell of a drug in terms of independence. I&amp;rsquo;m in control.</description>
