#lassediercks website

This is the sourcecode for my [website](http://lassediercks.de/)

It's powered by my [pattern library](http://lassediercks.github.io/design)

##why github?

I like to manage things with github issues

##why transparent?

I'm always curious how other websites are working so I have no hard feeling about sharing mine.


##local setup

you should be fine with

`npm i && npm start`

##anything I could do better?

There is always something worth improving, I'd love to know what you think. Just create an issue or [write me on twitter](http://www.twitter.com/lassediercks)
