#I am Lasse Diercks, I am a Designer with a focus on the technical Design execution process of web interfaces. This is my manifesto.

I am creating design for humans. Always will that human being be the focus of my design. 

I give feedback to anyone and I will recieve feedback from anyone.
 
I am one part of a bigger process. I depend on a good decision making of steakholders as well as the ones who bring my design to life.

I will keep my knowldege up to date in order to stay competitive.
 
I am biased. To ensure diveristy and avoid blind spots I need different people than I am to challenge and improve my design. 

I respect design as a craftsmanship and will fight for that mindest.

I believe in the power of design systems. To think in components, not in finished arrengement.

I am not pleasing. I will fight for everything mentioned above.
